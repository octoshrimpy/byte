_an open-source _alternative_ to short-form_ video communities_

---

## Ideas

* built-in Pomodoro for timed sessions
* no targetted ads
* let content creators decide what ads show after their videos
  * turning around who owns who in advertising
* Reddit-like communities
  * recommendations based on followed communities (Tumblr?)
* save vs like vs verb
* against addiction at all costs
* smaller vids with lower resolution = good compression and storage
* browse and share without login required
*
